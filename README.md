# Victor's dmenu

Forked from Luke Smith's dmenu

Extra stuff added to vanilla dmenu:

- reads Xresources
- alpha patch
- can view color characters like emoji (libxft-bgra is required for this reason)
- `-P` for password mode: hide user input
- `-r` to reject non-matching input
- `-c` for centered dmenu
